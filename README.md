The coefficient of variation is a useful metric for assessing and comparing variations between different datasets. 
It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean and multiplying the result by 100, yielding a percentage. 
This measure effectively captures the spread of a dataset, making it applicable for comparing data with different units or scales. 
Additionally, the coefficient of variation serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the stability of variables or scales within a dataset.

(b)
